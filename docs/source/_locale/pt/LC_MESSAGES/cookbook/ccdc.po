"CCDC is a holistic methodological framework that encompasses various "
"aspects of space-borne, multitemporal land mapping and monitoring using "
"multitemporal satellite imagery. The core aspect of the method is a "

"The temporal segmentation step starts by fitting a third-order harmonic "

"observations are tested against the model for each band selected as a "
"*breakpoint band*. In the event of significant repetitive deviation from "
"the model, a break is flagged. Subsequently, a new segment is initialized"

"A *CCDC asset* retains the information of change(s) occurring for each "

"consider it as a *condensed, synthetic time series*. By only storing each"
