"The logic of using a comparison to the modelled value from one year "

"usually interested in a monitoring period the spans days to weeks, but "
"not the entire year (the default value of the monitoring period is two "
"months). Changes that happen within the year – but before the monitoring "
"period – would be included. The method therefore introduces a calibration"
" period that directly precedes the monitoring period. Confirmed changes "
"that already happened before or during the calibration period are not "
"included in the final output by default. This is to ensure that the user "
"only receives alerts for changes that happened during the monitoring "
"period. The length of the calibration period is defined by the user "
"(three months by default). The advanced options allow to turn this "
"behaviour off."
