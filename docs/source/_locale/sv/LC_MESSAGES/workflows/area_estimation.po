"In this article, you will learn how to perform area estimation for land "
"use/land cover and two-date change detection classifications. We will use"
" sample-based approaches to area estimation. This approach is preferred "
"over pixel-counting methods because all maps have errors (e.g. maps "
"derived from land cover/land use classifications may have errors due to "
"pixel mixing or noise in the input data). Using pixel-counting methods "
"will produce biased estimates of area; you cannot tell whether these are "

"There are four steps to sample-based estimation of area and accuracy. "
"First, you will use the different classes in your LULC or change "
"detection map to create a stratified sampling design in SEPAL using the "
"**Stratified Area Estimator (SAE) - Design** tool (Exercise 4.1). Then "
"you will revisit your response design and labelling protocols to use with"

"generated in CEO (Exercise 4.3) to calculate the sample-based estimates "
"in SEPAL, using the **Stratified Area Estimator-Analysis** tool (Exercise"

#~ "It is best to use comments "
