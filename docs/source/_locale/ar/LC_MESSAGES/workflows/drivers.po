"Deforestation and forest degradation are complex processes that have many"
" underlying causes. A comprehensive understanding of forest conversion to"
" other land uses is instrumental for the development of policies and "
"actions aiming to reduce the loss of forests and associated carbon "
"emissions. It is important to understand recurring patterns and "
"correlations that can help countries tailor their efforts toward reducing"
" forest loss."

"The causes of deforestation and forest degradation vary both regionally "
"and temporally (Curtis, 2018). Different studies refer to agricultural "
"expansion (cropland and pasture) as the largest direct cause of global "
"deforestation (FAO, 2022; Gibbs, 2010; Hosonuma, 2012; Kissinger, 2012; "
"Sandker, 2017). Commercial agriculture is estimated to be responsible for"
" around 70–90 percent of worldwide deforestation. In Africa, both "
"commercial and subsistence agriculture may account for similar importance"
" in terms of forest loss, while fuelwood collection, charcoal production,"
" and livestock grazing in forests (to a lesser extent), are the most "
"important drivers of degradation."

"However, these studies (as well as existing national studies on the "
"drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Central Africa) are "
"generally based on data acquired up to 2014 and do not consider the "
"recent trends in observed tree cover loss. They also do not take into "
"account the importance of the spatial fragmentation of forests and the "
"role played by degradation induced by forest exploitation (Molinario, "
"2015). Furthermore, they simplify causes of deforestation into a single "
"driver, which does not adequately reflect the complex local context and "
"interacting causes – decisions that lead to anthropogenic forest "
"disturbance at local levels (Ferrer-velasco, 2020)."

"These recent trends and the lack of updated studies result in little "
"consensus on the main drivers and agents of forest change at regional "
"levels. There is a pressing need to systematically quantify the direct "
"causes of deforestation and degradation via a systematic and "
"comprehensive approach. An updated assessment should provide validated "
"evidence on the role and weight of different drivers of forest loss and "
"support decision-making to address related challenges. A spatially "
"explicit approach should also facilitate the assessment of the efficiency"
" of policies and actions in different contexts. Improved spatial data on "
"deforestation and forest degradation, as well as an improved "
"understanding of the drivers, will support land-use planning approaches "
